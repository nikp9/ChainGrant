## 🧩 Problem Statement

Traditional grant management systems face several challenges:

- ❌ Lack of transparency in scoring and approvals.
- ❌ Delays and misallocation in fund disbursement.
- ❌ Complex and biased selection processes.
- ❌ Barriers for independent or underrepresented researchers.
- ❌ Poor traceability and data security in centralized systems.

## ✅ Our Solution

ChainGrant provides a blockchain-based solution featuring:

- 🔒 **Anonymous Project Submissions** — Removes bias by hiding identities until approval.
- 🔗 **Immutable Ledger** — Every action is stored securely and transparently.
- ⚙️ **Smart Contracts** — Automate milestone-based fund disbursements.
- 🌐 **User-Friendly Design** — No need to hold cryptocurrency to interact with the application.
- 📊 **Transparent Scoring & Decisions** — All evaluations are publicly auditable.
